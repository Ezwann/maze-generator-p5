A very simple maze generator using backtracking.

To do this, I follow videos from Daniel Shiftman (from [The Coding Train channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw))

The original challenge is in 4 parts :
[Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4)
[Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8UgRyRnvXU)
[Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ju_uxJ9v44)
[Part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p5IH0L63wo)

While playing with the settings, I've decided to add a wavy pinkish color effect and a GCD function to scale the cells (cells still maintain a 15px minimum, to not kill your browser).

I also added a [GitHub page](https://ezwann.github.io/maze-generator-p5/) to let people visualize the result.
